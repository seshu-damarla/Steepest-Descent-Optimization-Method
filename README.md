# Steepest-Descent-Optimization-Method
The Steepest Descent (Cauchy) Method is an iterative optimization technique used to find the minimum of a function by following the path of steepest decrease, guided by the function's gradient. Here’s how it works in simple terms:

Starting Point: The method begins with an initial guess. This is the point where we start searching for the minimum.

Calculate Gradient: At each step, we calculate the gradient, which is a vector pointing in the direction where the function’s value increases the fastest. This tells us the slope of the function at that point.

Move in Opposite Direction: Since we want to find the minimum, we move in the opposite direction of the gradient. This "downhill" direction takes us closer to lower values of the function.

Control Step Size: Each step is scaled by a learning rate (step size), which controls how far we move in that direction. Choosing a good learning rate is important: if it’s too high, we might overshoot the minimum, and if it’s too low, the process can be very slow.

Repeat Until Convergence: The process is repeated—calculating the gradient and taking steps in the opposite direction—until we reach a point where further steps don't significantly reduce the function's value, which indicates we’re close to the minimum.

Stopping Condition: We stop either when the steps become very small (indicating we’re near the minimum) or when we reach a set maximum number of steps.

The Steepest Descent Method is straightforward and effective for simple functions, but it can be slow for complex functions, especially if there are narrow valleys. This method is popular for learning and small-scale optimization tasks due to its simplicity.
